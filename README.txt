NAME OF PROJECT:
================
Encrypting & Decrypting in AES mode CBC

NAME OF PROGRAMMER:
===================
Ashley J
Michal L

STATEMENT:
==========
I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this work.
However, Sully allowed for Michal L and Ashley J to work together on this assignment 

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
=====================
Describe where the files can be found.
    File 1: AES_encrypt_decrypt.py
    File 2: plaintext1.txt
    File 3: plaintext1.txt.enc
    File 4: plaintext1.txt.dec

Provide any special instructions to access or run your program.
    To run this program you will need the files AES_encrypt_decrypt.py & plaintext1.txt
    1. Start the program via command line
    2. You will be asked with a menu option to encrypt/decrypt/exit -- press '1' for encrypt
    3. You will need to enter in a file name, you can use the file "plaintext1.txt" or any file in your director 
    4. Now a new file will be created with the new encryption. This file should be called 'plaintext1.txt.enc' unless you choose a different file name
    5. The menu option should show on the command line. Press '2' to decrypt. 
    6. Type the file that was just created called 'plaintext1.txt.enc'
    7. Now a new file should've been created called 'plaintext1.txt.dec' -- you should be able to see the plaintext again
    8. exit the program by pressing '3' whenever you feel
